# 🟠 Life Calendar Wallpaper

> A minimalist Android wallpaper app that visualizes your year and life as a grid of dots — automatically updated on your lockscreen every night at midnight.

---

## ✨ Features

- **Year Calendar** — Every day of the year visualized as a dot. White = past, Orange = today, Grey = future
- **Life Calendar** — Your entire life mapped in weeks based on your date of birth and expected lifespan( Future Scope, its not working as of now )
- **Auto Refresh** — Wallpaper regenerates automatically at midnight every night using WorkManager
- **Live Stats** — Shows days elapsed, % of year complete, and days remaining
- **DOB Form** — Enter your date of birth and the app calculates your life in weeks (default lifespan set to 72 years — avg Indian lifespan)
- **Wallpaper Picker** — Saves generated image to gallery and opens Android's native wallpaper picker to set on home screen + lockscreen

## 📐 How It Works

### Year Calendar
1. App calculates `dayOfYear` for today's date
2. Draws a 7-column dot grid (1 row = 1 week) for all 365/366 days
3. Colors each dot — white for past, orange for today, dark grey for future
4. Adds stats text at the bottom showing days left and % complete
5. Saves bitmap to gallery and opens wallpaper picker

### Life Calendar
1. User enters their date of birth and expected lifespan (default 72 years)
2. App calculates total weeks lived vs total weeks in lifespan
3. Draws a 52-column dot grid (1 row = 1 year, 1 dot = 1 week)
4. Colors dots — white for lived weeks, orange for current week, dark grey for future
5. Saves to SharedPreferences so midnight refresh works automatically

### Midnight Refresh
1. On first launch, WorkManager schedules a daily task
2. Task fires at midnight, regenerates the wallpaper bitmap
3. Saves new image to gallery silently in the background

## 📋 Known Limitations

- **Android 13+ lockscreen** — Android 13 and above no longer allows third party apps to set the lockscreen wallpaper programmatically. The app uses Android's native wallpaper picker instead, where users can choose home screen, lockscreen, or both
- **Emulator** — Wallpaper setting may not work on emulators due to system restrictions. Test on a real device for best results
